## Lessons Learned

1. Running the tests after each significant change to the code or the styling is a good practice. It allows us to catch any issues early and fix them before they become more difficult to debug.
2. Following the TDD method strictly ensures that the code is thoroughly tested and reduces the chances of introducing bugs.
3. Breaking the application into smaller reusable components makes the code more manageable and easier to test.
4. Reflecting on the mistakes and identifying areas of improvement is crucial for learning and improving our development skills.
5. Styling the app to make it visually appealing, responsive and user friendly enhances the user experience.
